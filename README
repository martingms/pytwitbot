= Description = 

A lightweight multithreading twitter bot framework written in Python, with plugin support

= License =

GPL v.2.0

= Requirements =

Tested with python-2.7

oauthtwitter (modified version included)
simplejson (available through easy_install)
oauth2 (available through easy_install)

= Installation =

To set up the bot with the twitter account of your choosing,
be logged on to it on twitter web, and run the access_token_generator.py script.

To run the bot, run the run.py script or do something like:

from pytwitbot import TwitterBot

t = TwitterBot()
t.runBot()

in one of your own scripts.

= Plugins =

To make a new plugin, simply look at the sample plugins included in the plugins.py file and duplicate.
Put your code within the run-function of the class. If you find a better way to do the plugin system, let me know

To install a plugin (make it run when starting the bot), simply make a variable of the class
and add it to the plugins array at the bottom of plugins.py. Again, not very elegant, so if you have a better system,
let me know.
